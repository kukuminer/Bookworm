Bookworm Project
by Liran Zheku
ICS4U final project 2018

-

To play the game, run bookworm.exe
It will only work on a windows computer and requires a resolution of at least 1280x800 (currently).
Unfortunately, some of the in game music files were too large to upload to github. 

-

To open the project itself, use codeblocks with the proper SFML libraries installed (all of them, version 2.4.2).

-

To open the code, use a text editor.
Header files are found in 'include' - they are the .h and .hpp files
Source files are found in 'src' - they are the .cpp files

-

A quick rundown of the C++ file formats:
Header files contain declarations of all the fields and functions of that class
Source files contain implementation and initialization of the above fields and functions
Each header file has a corresponding source file and vice versa, except for main.cpp as this is the main class.

-

Features to implement: (Probably won't implement at this point)
- Overkill bonus on enemies
