Bookworm Project
by Liran Zheku
ICS4U final project 2018

---

To play the game, run bookworm.exe (or backup.exe if it doesn't exist)  
It will only work on a windows computer and requires a resolution of at least 1280x800 (currently).   
Unfortunately, some of the in game music files were too large to upload to github.

To open the project itself, use codeblocks with the proper SFML libraries installed (all of them, version 2.4.2).  

---

To open the code, use a text editor.  
Header files are found in 'include' - they are the .h and .hpp files  
Source files are found in 'src' - they are the .cpp files  

---

A quick rundown of the C++ file formats:  
Header files contain declarations of all the fields and functions of that class  
Source files contain implementation and initialization of the above fields and functions  
Each header file has a corresponding source file and vice versa, except for main.cpp as this is the main class.  

---

Features to implement: (Probably won't implement at this point)  
- Overkill bonus on enemies
